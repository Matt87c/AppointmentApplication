Java development with JUnit testing.

Testing can ensure a code, program, or software is functional and secure.  Peer code review will also ensure functional and secure software.  Junit test are setup to run the functions of the software.  This will let the tester know if the software working correctly or has bugs that need to be address before production.  If the software passes the JUnit tests, then the code is sent for a peer review.  This peer review will allow outside input about the code to help discover and enhance the functions.  The testing and peer code reviews will reinforce a more stable software.  This will also make the software more secure.  
My approach with designing software is a Scrum Agile software development methodology.  This methodology will have user needs that will need to be incorporated into the program.  These user needs will be written into a backlog.  The requirements of the software will be represented by user stories.  The user stories are pulled from the backlog to be worked on by developers.  The developers will have sprints.  A sprint planning will be an event the team collaborates to discuss what can get done in the sprint and how to complete the work.  The team will get together to check in daily of the progress.  A sprint review will allow the team to show their work.  Finally, a sprint retrospective will occur to find ways to improve for the following sprint.
